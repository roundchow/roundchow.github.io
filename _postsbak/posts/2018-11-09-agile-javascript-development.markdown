</pre>

## Key Points

· [JSON](https://www.json.org/)

<pre>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.

</pre>

· [Ajax](http://www.adaptivepath.org/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/)

<pre>

Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) is a set of Web development techniques using many Web technologies on the client side to create asychronous Web applications.

</pre>

· [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)

<pre>

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.[1] A web page may freely embed cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos.[2] Certain "cross-domain" requests, notably Ajax requests, are forbidden by default by the same-origin security policy.

CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether or not it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.[3] It allows for more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin requests, but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests. The specification for CORS was originally published as a W3C Recommendation[4] but that document is obsolete.[5] The current actively-maintained specification that defines CORS is WHATWG's Fetch Living Standard.[6] 

</pre>

· [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

<pre>

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

</pre>

· [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

<pre>

Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the world's most popular front-end component library (Bootstrap自己说的).

Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS and JS. Quickly prototype the ideas or build the entire app with the Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.

</pre>

· [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)

<pre>

Less (which stands for Leaner Style Sheets) is a backwards-compatible language extension for CSS. This is the official documentation for Less, the language and Less.js, the JavaScript tool that converts your Less styles to CSS styles.

Because Less looks just like CSS, learning it is a breeze. Less only makes a few convenient additions to the CSS language, which is one of the reasons it can be learned so quickly.

</pre>

· [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

<pre>

Heroku is a cloud platform based on a managed container system, with integrated data services and powerful ecosystem, for deploying and runnding modern apps.

</pre>

· [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)

<pre>

 Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

</pre>

· [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

<pre>

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

</pre>

· [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

<pre>

npm is the package manager for JavaScript and the world’s largest software registry. Discover packages of reusable code — and assemble them in powerful new ways.

</pre>

· [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb)

<pre>

MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.

</pre>

· [BSON](http://bsonspec.org/)

<pre>

BSON [bee · sahn], short for Bin­ary JSON, is a bin­ary-en­coded seri­al­iz­a­tion of JSON-like doc­u­ments. Like JSON, BSON sup­ports the em­bed­ding of doc­u­ments and ar­rays with­in oth­er doc­u­ments and ar­rays. BSON also con­tains ex­ten­sions that al­low rep­res­ent­a­tion of data types that are not part of the JSON spec. For ex­ample, BSON has a Date type and a BinData type.

</pre>

· [软件部署](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_deployment)

<pre>

Software deployment is all of the activities that make a software system available for use.

The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. These activities can occur at the producer side or at the consumer side or both. Because every software system is unique, the precise processes or procedures within each activity can hardly be defined. Therefore, "deployment" should be interpreted as a general process that has to be customized according to specific requirements or characteristics. 

</pre>

· [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP)

<pre>

JSONP (JSON with Padding or JSON-P) is a JavaScript pattern to request data by loading a script tag. JSONP enables sharing of data bypassing same-origin policy.
